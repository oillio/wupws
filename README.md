This fork was created to build a Docker image for this script.  All variables listed below should be set by your environment.

# wupws
simple shell script that parses current observations from a weather underground station and posts to pwsweather.com.  Needed so Rachio smart irrigation controller can use nearby weather underground data to adjust watering schedule.

Mandatory Linux Tools Required:

- WUAPI={your weather underground API key - no braces}
- WUPWS={"your weather underground station identifier - no braces - yes quotes"}
- PWSID={your pwsweather.com station ID}
- PWSPASS={your pwsweather.com password}

Workflow:
- Sign up for a Weather Underground free (Stratus) API key
- Sign up for a pwsweather.com account
- Create a new weather station under your pwsweather.com account using the (lat/long/elevation/etc) from the Weather Underground station you wish to track
- edit the script with all of your personal variables
- set a cronjob to run the script with your desired frequency - keep it at every 3 minutes or more to stay under the WU 500 API calls/day limit
